## ðŸ“„ Assumptions, Design Choices, and Important Details

### Assumptions
- The legal document corpus is provided as a single PDF (`docs/laws.pdf`).
- The application is intended for demonstration and evaluation, not for production use as-is.

### Design Choices
- **CORS** is set to allow all origins for ease of testing (should be restricted in production).

### Important Details
- **PDF Parsing**: The `DocumentService` parses the PDF into logical law sections using regex. If no structure is found, it falls back to paragraph/sentence splitting.
- **Querying**: The `/query` endpoint uses semantic search to find the top-k most relevant law sections and returns them with citations.
