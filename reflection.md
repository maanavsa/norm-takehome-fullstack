What unique challenges do you foresee in developing and integrating AI regulatory agents for legal
compliance from a full-stack perspective? How would you address these challenges to make the system
robust and user-friendly?


At the current state, AI agents can provide incorrect information or be constrained to certain behaviors which may not always provide the most optimal responses. These models will need to be extensively trained but have to be done carefully as many legal cases contain sensitive and private data. On the backend, we should be careful about how we're ingesting the data and have mechanisms to protect privacy. The user facing UI can have options and tags to mark sensitive data or a confidence evaluation over responses. Citations are necessary as we've seen in this exercise. Providing direct links to these citations and the ability to see more context around the citations would also be helpful to make sure they're being understood accurately.
